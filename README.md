# Mobile Gaming: screen addiction or just fiction?

### By Kyle M and Brandon T

#### Does mobile gaming lead to higher screen times?

Youâ€™d think that gaming leads to higher screen times, right?  That all the time you spend earning trophies on supercell games, clicking circles in rhythm games, and spending all your money on jpegs should add up over time? Well we we curious on the topic and thought so too, so we performed a study on the screen usage students of Del Norte High School.  Here are our results.

Here's the plot of the hours of screen time spent by gamers

And here's the plot of screen time by non-gamers

Here's what that all "means" (get it cause we're showing you the mean and median ahahaha) <sub>(please laugh I'm begging you)</sub>

Our study was on 71 students from Del Norte, selected by a random sample stratified by grade using homeroom classes. This led to us finding 21 students who didn't play mobile games and 50 who did.  We then collected data for the time each student spent on screens to perform an analysis.

Now, if you just look at the base values of mean screen time, you'd say gamers on average have more screen time right?

WRONG WE TRICKED YOU WITH THE POWER OF STATS
