**Mobile Gaming: is it screen addiction or just fiction?**
Does mobile gaming lead to higher screen times?

So, does it?

Youâ€™d think that gaming leads to higher screen times right? All those trophies on supercell games, rhythm gaming, and spending all your money on jpegs should add up over time right? Well we did a study on the students of Del Norte High School and here are our results

Our study was on 72 students from Del Norte, a random stratified sample by grade of homerooms. This led to 22 people without games on their device, and 50 with games on their device

Based on the the amount of hours of screen time they put, we made graphs of their screen time, and those are the results of those graphs.

Now, if you just look at the base values of mean screen time, you'd say gamers on average have more screen time right?

WRONG WE TRICKED YOU WITH THE POWER OF STATS
