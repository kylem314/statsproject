## Does mobile gaming lead to higher screen times?

Youâ€™d think that gaming leads to higher screen times, right?  That all the time you spend earning trophies on supercell games, clicking circles in rhythm games, and spending all your money on jpegs should add up over time? Well we were curious on the topic and thought so too, so we performed a study on the screen usage students of Del Norte High School.  Here are our results.

Here's the plot of the hours of screen time spent by gamers

And here's the plot of screen time by non-gamers

Here's what that all "means" (get it cause we're showing you the mean and median ahahaha) <sub>(please laugh I'm begging you)</sub>

Our study was on 71 students from Del Norte, selected by a random sample stratified by grade using homeroom classes since there could be discrepancies between grades due to factors such as how much free time students have or what they use their phones for. This led to us finding 21 students who didn't play mobile games and 50 who did.  We then collected data for the time each student spent on screens to perform an analysis.

Now, if you just look at the base values of mean screen time, you'd say gamers on average have more screen time right?

WRONG WE TRICKED YOU WITH THE POWER OF STATS

Although our higher mean for the hours spent by mobile gamers provides some evidence of a correlation between mobile games and screen time usage, we were unable to find convincing evidence to support that claim, rendering our study inconclusive.  If there truly isn't a difference in means between mobile gamers and non-mobile gamers, this would lead us to believe that even if people don't play mobile games, the time they spend on other applications such as social media or youtube makes up that time differential.  

Even though we weren't able to prove a correlation between screen time and mobile games, we hope our study helped to shed some light on the topic.  Thanks for reading!
